# conformal-RUL-intervals

This repository contains the code for the paper: ["Conformal Prediction Intervals for Remaining Useful Lifetime
Estimation"] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14612.pdf),
written by Alireza Javanmardi and Eyke HÃ¼llermeier.
This paper is going to appear in International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management (IJPHM) 2023.

In this project we are providing intervals as the output to represent the uncertainty of our predictions. Hence, instead of a providing a point prediction, we provide a lower and an upper bound on the RUL.
